# Sentiment Analysis

This project performs sentiment analysis using machine learning and natural language processing. 
The goal is to classify a given text as Positive, Negative, or Neutral.



# Step 1: Import the Dataset
We begin by importing a dataset that contains text data along with their sentiment labels. 
This dataset can be in CSV format and may include reviews, tweets, or comments.

Example:
| Text                                | Sentiment  |
|-------------------------------------|------------|
| I love this product!                | Positive   |
| The service was terrible.           | Negative   |
| It’s okay, nothing special.         | Neutral    |

### 🔹 Step 2: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Raw text data often contains noise. To prepare it for analysis, we apply the following preprocessing steps:

- **Convert to lowercase** – To treat words like "Good" and "good" as the same.
- **Remove punctuations and special characters** – To avoid unnecessary symbols.
- **Tokenization** – Break text into words or tokens.
- **Stopword removal** – Remove common words like "the", "is", "and" that do not carry much meaning.
- **Stemming or Lemmatization** – Reduce words to their root form (e.g., “running” → “run”).

---

### 🔹 Step 3: Feature Extraction
Since machine learning models work with numbers, we convert text into numeric form using these techniques:

- **Bag of Words (BoW)** – Represents text by counting word occurrences.
- **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)** – Measures how important a word is to a document in a collection.

---

### 🔹 Step 4: Model Selection and Training
After feature extraction, we train the model using classification algorithms like:

- **Logistic Regression**
- **Naive Bayes**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**

We split the data into training and testing sets to ensure the model learns and generalizes well.

---

### 🔹 Step 5: Model Evaluation
We evaluate the performance of the trained model using metrics such as:

- **Accuracy** – Overall correctness
- **Precision** – Correct positive predictions
- **Recall** – Ability to find all positive samples
- **F1-score** – Balance between precision and recall
- **Confusion Matrix** – Summary of prediction results

---

### 🔹 Step 6: Make Predictions
Now the model can take any new text input and predict its sentiment.

Example:
- Input: *“This phone has amazing battery life!”*
- Output: **Positive**

---

### 🔹 Step 7: Visualization (Optional)
To better understand the data and results, we use graphs like:

- Word clouds
- Bar graphs for sentiment counts
- Confusion matrix heatmaps

---

### 🔹 Step 8: Future Enhancements
Some possible improvements:
- Use Deep Learning models like **LSTM** or **BERT** for better accuracy
- Deploy the model as a web app using **Flask** or **Streamlit**
- Perform real-time sentiment analysis using **Twitter API**

### ✅ Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to process text data, train a classification model, and evaluate its performance to understand sentiment from user-generated content. 
Sentiment Analysis is widely used in business, social media monitoring, and customer service to make smarter decisions.
